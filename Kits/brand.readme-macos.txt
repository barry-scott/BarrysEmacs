macOS notes

    There is a command line tool included on Barry's Emacs disk. 

    bemacs is the command line client that can be used to start
    the Barry's Emacs Application from the command line or a CLI
    version.

    To start the GUI version use:

        $ bemacs

    To start the CLI version use:

        $ bemacs -cli

    Useful when you cannot use the GUI version.  For example when
    connected to a Mac via ssh or when using sudo.

    Copy these to a folder on your PATH, typically this is ~/bin.
